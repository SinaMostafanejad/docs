There are two things could change:
- The `train.py` which the sweep uses
- The files that `train.py` references (such as other scripts, letâ€™s say a `helper.py` with helper functions is imported in `train.py`)

If you change `train.py` during a sweep, the sweep will continue to use the original version of `train.py`. It will not use the updated version of `train.py`.

However, if you change `helper.py` during the sweep, the sweep will use the newer version of `helper.py`.
